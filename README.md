# OpenSeaUploaderWithSelenium

You need to understand the code, I'm using this repo to exchange the script between my comuters.

You need to install selenium via:
```
npm  install
```
and chromedriver via
```
npm install chromedriver -g 
```

After that, you have to start chromedriver once via the "just-login.js" to install MetaMask Plugin and to import your wallet into MetaMask.

At the moment I just Upload and do not sell the items.

I think for selling I need a different script, because opensea crashes often.

I tried to get rid of all crashes from the website.
