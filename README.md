# OpenSeaUploaderWithSelenium

You need to understand the code, I'm using this repo to exchange the script between my comuters.

You need to install selenium via:
```
npm  install
```
and chromedriver via
```
npm install chromedriver -g 
```

After that, you have to start chromedriver once via the "just-login.js" to install MetaMask Plugin and to import your wallet into MetaMask.
